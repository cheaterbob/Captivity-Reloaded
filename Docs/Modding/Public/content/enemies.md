# Enemies

`spawn.inheritTemplateSpawners: true` adds a variant anywhere its Core template already spawns. The optional experimental `spawn.selectionWeight` controls its relative frequency and defaults to `1`. Existing Core choices each have weight `1`; one variant with weight `0.25` therefore has a `0.25 / (1 + 0.25)`, or 20%, share when competing with one matching Core enemy. Multiple variants add their weights to the denominator.

Inherited enemies extend a stable Core enemy ID. They can currently override bounded statistics, inherited attacks, selected behavior modules, drop rules, animation speed, spawning behavior, and published rig sprites.

The Zombie I LibreSprite kit in `ModSDK/EnemyTemplates/Zombie1` builds a named-layer 128×128 atlas from the exact Core sprites. It inherits `core:enemy/zombie-1`, including the original rig, animation clips, colliders, and specialized prefab behavior.

## Fully original enemies (experimental)

Omit `extends` and use `visual.type: originalSkeletonAtlas` to make an enemy without cloning a Core NPC. The runtime constructs the actor rigidbody and body collider, sprite bones, projectile hit zones, ragdoll joints, attacks, procedural animation set, and reviewed AI from data. A complete example is `ExampleMods/prey-green-zombie/content/original-green-stalker.json`.

An original visual requires:

- `regions`: rectangles within one pack-local PNG atlas.
- `bones`: up to 64 named bones. Every bone selects a region and may name a parent. A `hips` bone is required. Local `x`, `y`, `rotation`, pivot, and sorting order are explicit, so the hierarchy is not limited to the humanoid Core rig.
- `hitZones`: box or circle projectile zones attached to named bones. One zone per bone may use `low`, `normal`, `critical`, or `block` damage.
- `bodyWidth`, `bodyHeight`, and optional body offsets: the solid capsule used for floors and walls. Hit zones are triggers and do not replace this movement collider.

`animation.clips` contains named procedural clips. Each clip has an ordered list of frames; a frame supplies an atlas `region`, absolute local position, rotation, or scale values for any subset of bones. Sprite regions switch at the authored frame while transforms interpolate between frames. `idle` and `move` are required. Attack definitions reference another clip by name and specify the exact hit time, total duration, ranges, damage, knockback, chance, and cooldown.

Clips may instead live in separate normalized `enemyAnimation` documents. Map a semantic clip name to its content ID with `animationRefs`, for example `"move": "your.pack:enemy-animation/stalker-move"`. The document's `enemy` must identify the owning enemy. Bone targets are checked against that enemy's declared skeleton. Numeric tracks support position, rotation, scale, sprite color, and sorting order. Object tracks switch atlas regions by `name`, or load a pack-local PNG directly when the sprite key supplies `asset`. Inline clips and references can be mixed but cannot define the same semantic name.

Standalone attack delivery types are:

- `melee`: applies an impact inside `hitRange`.
- `hitscan`: verifies range and line of sight and displays the Core tracer.
- `projectile`: launches an atlas-backed Rigidbody2D projectile toward the player's position at the firing moment. It requires `projectileRegion`, `projectileSpeed`, `projectileLifetimeSeconds`, and `projectileRadius`; `projectileGravityScale` defaults to zero. A non-zero gravity scale produces an aim-compensated ballistic arc. Projectiles are destroyed when they hit the player, a platform, or their lifetime expires.
- `area`: applies an impact within `areaRadius` around a facing-relative `offsetX` and local `offsetY` from the enemy.
- `grab`: starts that enemy's `downedFinisher` QTE on a target inside `hitRange`. Consequently, an enemy containing a grab must also define the finisher module.
- `multiStage`: consumes 2–16 ordered `stages`, with exactly one ordered `attackHit` animation event per stage. Every stage selects `melee`, `hitscan`, `projectile`, `area`, or `grab` and may override damage, knockback, range, offsets, or projectile settings; omitted stage values inherit the containing attack.

### Enemy animation events

Non-looping clips referenced by an attack or finisher may contain an ordered `events` track. `attackHit` performs the current attack delivery at that exact point in the animation. Multiple markers repeat a normal delivery; for `multiStage`, they consume the declared stages in order. When at least one `attackHit` marker exists, it replaces the attack's legacy `hitTimeSeconds`; otherwise `hitTimeSeconds` remains the fallback and one of the two timing methods is required. A `cue` is an inert semantic timeline marker with an optional bounded `index` and `amount`; it is available to authoring tools but never invokes a Unity method or gameplay code. Unlike gameplay events, inert cues may also appear on looping clips.

`impulse` applies a bounded physics impulse to the enemy. Its `x` value points forward by default and is mirrored when the enemy faces left; set `relativeToFacing` to `false` to use world-space X.

Presentation events use the same timing track:

- `sound` plays a pack-local WAV or OGG through a positional SFX source. `volume` defaults to `1`.
- `cameraShake` takes a bounded `amount` from `0` through `1`.
- `spriteEffect` briefly displays an existing atlas `region`, optionally attached to a named `bone`. It supports local `x`/`y`, `durationSeconds`, uniform `scale`, and `sortingOrder`.

Enemy-side gameplay events are restricted to attack and finisher clips and cannot be placed on looping clips in this first version. Inert semantic cues are allowed on loops. Player-side finisher events may loop with their player animation. Event audio is loaded safely from the defining pack, capped at 32 MiB per file, and never resolves outside the pack directory.

```json
"swipe": {
  "durationSeconds": 0.55,
  "loop": false,
  "frames": [
    { "time": 0, "bones": { "chest": { "rotation": -12 } } },
    { "time": 0.22, "bones": { "chest": { "rotation": 20 } } }
  ],
  "events": [
    { "time": 0.16, "type": "impulse", "x": 0.35 },
    { "time": 0.22, "type": "attackHit" },
    { "time": 0.22, "type": "cameraShake", "amount": 0.15 },
    { "time": 0.22, "type": "spriteEffect", "region": "hit-flash", "bone": "hand-right", "durationSeconds": 0.08 }
  ]
}
```

The shared scheduler keeps gameplay timing in data without importing arbitrary Unity animation events. `spriteEffect` remains the simple bounded atlas-sprite option; normalized animation documents may additionally define bounded particle, `light`, `trail`, and `decal` effects with timed effect triggers. A presentation effect may reference a safe pack-local PNG in `texture`, divide it with `textureSheetTilesX` and `textureSheetTilesY`, and choose `textureSheetFrame` using top-left row order. Decals require a texture. Light intensity/radius, trail width/persistence, and decal pixels-per-unit have explicit bounded fields. These presentation effects do not add arbitrary damage or script callbacks.

Reviewed standalone AI types are `groundChase`, `flyingChase`, and `holdPosition`. Chasers face and approach the player, maintain `preferredRange`, and select configured attacks; optional `retreatRange` makes them back away when the player gets too close. Flying chase uses gravity-free two-axis movement. A stationary enemy can still select attacks inside its initiate range. `reactionSeconds` bounds how often each AI makes a new decision. Ground enemies use the stage navigation graph to reach higher platforms through directed `climb` links. When pursuing a player below, they leave the platform and fall naturally instead of climbing downward. Authors should provide links in every direction that an enemy is expected to travel.

Original enemies cannot set `spawn.inheritTemplateSpawners`, because there is no template whose spawn list can be inherited. Reference their full content ID from a data-driven stage spawner instead. The format remains experimental while custom rigs receive gameplay testing.

Published behavior modules currently include regeneration, low-health berserk, lifesteal, reflected `thorns` damage, `onHitRagdoll`, `onHitEquipClothing`, content-ID-based `spawnOnDeath`, and periodic `speedPulse` movement bursts. Modules are bounded and composable; inherited attack entries can separately override damage, chance, ranges, timing, knockback, and whether the enemy moves during the attack.

`onHitEquipClothing` gives every successful attack by that enemy a bounded chance to attach a registered Core or mod garment. `cooldownSeconds` prevents repeated attachment attempts. The referenced clothing must be loaded and registered or the enemy definition is rejected.

```json
{
  "type": "onHitEquipClothing",
  "clothing": "your.pack:clothing/hex-band",
  "chance": 0.25,
  "cooldownSeconds": 8
}
```

### Downed-player finisher QTE

Fully original enemies may add one experimental `downedFinisher` behavior module. When the enemy is within `triggerRange` of a ragdolled player, or a player voluntarily exposing themself with the normal `Expose` binding (`S` by default), it starts Captivity's struggle meter. Keyboard, controller, and mobile use the same bounded QTE implementation.

```json
{
  "type": "downedFinisher",
  "triggerRange": 1.6,
  "startDelaySeconds": 0.25,
  "durationSeconds": 8,
  "meterMax": 100,
  "inputPower": 14,
  "inputPattern": "adaptive",
  "decayPerSecond": 2,
  "failureDamage": 20,
  "successRecoveryHealth": 8,
  "successStunSeconds": 2.5,
  "cooldownSeconds": 4,
  "animation": "finisher",
  "playerAnimation": {
    "durationSeconds": 0.8,
    "loop": true,
    "frames": [
      { "time": 0, "bones": { "chest": { "rotation": -12 }, "head": { "rotation": 8 } } },
      { "time": 0.4, "bones": { "chest": { "rotation": 12 }, "head": { "rotation": -8 } } },
      { "time": 0.8, "bones": { "chest": { "rotation": -12 }, "head": { "rotation": 8 } } }
    ],
    "events": [
      { "time": 0.4, "type": "libido", "amount": 1 },
      { "time": 0.4, "type": "scaledPleasure", "amount": 0.2 },
      { "time": 0.4, "type": "strengthDamage", "amount": 1 },
      { "time": 0.4, "type": "struggleDamage", "amount": 10 }
    ]
  }
}
```

Reaching `meterMax` releases the player, optionally restores health, and can ragdoll the enemy for `successStunSeconds`. Running out of time releases the player, applies `failureDamage`, and briefly knocks the player down. `animation` references an enemy procedural clip. Optional `playerAnimation` uses the same bounded, interpolated frame format for the published player bones and restores the player's previous pose afterward. Normalized player-animation references also support sprite, color, sorting, and particle presentation tracks.

`inputPattern` selects the struggle interaction and defaults to `adaptive` for compatibility:

- `adaptive` preserves the original behavior: alternating directions on keyboard, right-stick rotation on controller, and aim-stick rotation or Jump taps on mobile. Keyboard players may hold Jump for slower automatic progress.
- `alternate` requires discrete left/right inputs. Controller and mobile sticks must return to neutral between directions.
- `rotate` requires aim-stick rotation on controller/mobile and uses alternating directions as its keyboard fallback.
- `tap` requires repeated presses of the normal Jump action and displays that device's Jump glyph.

For a reusable curve-based animation, put a `playerAnimation` document in a content root and replace the inline object with `"playerAnimationRef": "your.pack:player-animation/example"`. Normalized position, rotation, and scale tracks are sampled through their authored linear or Hermite curves and converted into the same safe finisher player. A reference may be used on the top-level finisher or an individual phase. Missing IDs invalidate the pack, and an entry cannot define both `playerAnimation` and `playerAnimationRef`. Runtime v1 accepts the `core:player-rig/alex` rig. See `ExampleMods/prey-green-zombie/content/stalker-restraint.player-animation.json`.

For an ordered finisher, replace the single presentation with 2–8 `phases`. Each phase requires a unique `id`, its own `durationSeconds`, and an enemy `animation`; it may also provide a separate `playerAnimation`, `inputPattern`, `inputPower`, and `decayPerSecond`. The struggle meter persists between phases, while the prompt and input gesture may change. Phase animations restart at each transition, and enemy/player events use time relative to that phase. Reaching `meterMax` succeeds immediately; reaching the end of the last phase fails. Combined phase duration is capped at 300 seconds.

### Independent NPC participants

A phased `downedFinisher` may reserve up to three real secondary original-enemy instances. Each entry in `participants` defines a stable slot ID, the required enemy content ID, its join policy, ranges, pair offset, facing, and optional fallback animation. Phase-specific animations are selected through `participantAnimations` on each phase.

```json
"participants": [
  {
    "id": "assistant",
    "enemy": "your.pack:enemy/assistant",
    "joinPolicy": "phaseBoundary",
    "joinRange": 3,
    "approachRange": 9,
    "offsetX": 1.25,
    "offsetY": 0,
    "facing": "left",
    "animation": "assist-idle"
  }
]
```

`startOnly` slots are checked when the interaction begins and may be marked `required`. `phaseBoundary` slots are optional: matching unreserved enemies inside `approachRange` approach the active interaction, and enemies inside `joinRange` enter at the next phase boundary. They never jump into the middle of a phase. Runtime v1 limits participants to `originalSkeletonAtlas` enemies because each participant needs the modular animation controller.

While participating, each NPC has its AI, attacks, physics, collisions, animation, facing, position, and sorting state controlled by the QTE session. That state is restored on success, failure, cancellation, component disable, or participant removal. The owner and every secondary NPC are reserved so two active interactions cannot claim the same instance.

Optional `successOutcome` and `failureOutcome` objects replace the legacy fixed outcome fields. They may independently combine `healthDamage`, `strengthDamage`, `pleasure`, `libido`, `healthRecovery`, `enemyStunSeconds`, `playerRagdollSeconds`, and up to eight `equipClothing` content IDs. A common cursed-clothing setup puts `equipClothing` on `failureOutcome`, so the enemy attaches the garment only when the player loses the QTE. When an outcome object is omitted, the existing `successRecoveryHealth`, `successStunSeconds`, or `failureDamage` behavior remains in effect. The Green Stalker example demonstrates two phases with distinct animation/event rates and different success/failure effects.

```json
"failureOutcome": {
  "healthDamage": 10,
  "equipClothing": ["your.pack:clothing/hex-band"]
}
```

`playerAnimation.events` is a separate player-side event track. Each entry controls exactly one effect, and multiple entries may share a timestamp:

- `pleasure` adds its amount directly to the pleasure bar.
- `scaledPleasure` uses the Core libido-scaled pleasure formula.
- `libido` adds its amount to libido.
- `strengthDamage` removes its amount from the yellow strength bar.
- `struggleDamage` removes its amount in points from current QTE progress and cannot lower it below zero.
- `healthDamage` deals its amount as normal player health damage, including active difficulty, rule-profile, and clothing modifiers.

Events repeat on every cycle when `loop` is true. The example reproduces the main effects of a normal Zombie thrust at 0.4 seconds in each 0.8-second cycle; its `struggleDamage` is 10 points out of the configured 100-point meter. At most 64 events are allowed and every event time must fall within the clip duration. Positive amounts are required. `pleasure` and `scaledPleasure` are capped at 100 per event, `libido` and `struggleDamage` at 10,000, and damage events at 100,000.

Normalized player documents use the same event names in `name` and place the amount in `floatValue`. The runtime importer now also applies sprite-name tracks when their sprites are available, RGBA color tracks, sorting-order tracks, and bounded particle-effect triggers. Particle targets may name a published player bone or a bone on the paired enemy. The Green Stalker's drain phase uses a Squoid-derived two-trigger particle definition as the initial runtime presentation test.

The optional experimental `statuses` object customizes the existing status cards associated with a finisher. Supported keys are `active`, `mating`, `infusion`, `succumbed`, `orgasm`, `fertilized`, `pregnant`, `implanting`, `labor`, `birth`, and `mindBroken`. Each entry may override `title`, `description`, or both. Omitted entries use Captivity's normal wording. Text supports `{enemy}`, `{fetus}`, and `{child}` placeholders. Cards are connected to their real player events: for example, `active` lasts for the QTE, `orgasm` appears only on orgasm, and pregnancy-related cards appear only if a fetus is actually inserted.

```json
"statuses": {
  "active": { "title": "Pinned", "description": "{enemy} has you pinned!" },
  "succumbed": { "description": "You could not escape {enemy}..." },
  "fertilized": { "description": "{enemy} implanted a {fetus}." }
}
```

Published player bone names are `hips`, `butt`, `spine`, `chest`, `neck`, `head`, `arm-right-upper`, `arm-right-lower`, `hand-right`, `arm-left-upper`, `arm-left-lower`, `hand-left`, `leg-right-upper`, `leg-right-lower`, `foot-right`, `leg-left-upper`, `leg-left-lower`, `foot-left`, `ear`, and `face`.

This module deliberately defines a gameplay finisher rather than pregnancy, clothing, dialogue, or explicit scene behavior; those require separate reviewed modules and assets.
