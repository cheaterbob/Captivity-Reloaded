# Tiled maps

## Install and open the starter map

1. Download the desktop build for your operating system from the [official Tiled download page](https://www.mapeditor.org/download.html), install it, and launch it once. Captivity does not require a Tiled plugin or scripted extension.
2. Copy the complete `ModSDK/MapTemplates/TiledStage` directory into your mod workspace. Keep its `levels`, `templates`, `tilesets`, `assets`, and `reference` directories together so relative paths continue to resolve.
3. In Tiled, select **File > Open File or Project** and open `levels/starter-map.json` from the copied directory. If Tiled asks for a format, choose **JSON map files**.
4. Keep the map **Orthogonal** and **Finite**. Save it as JSON with raw tile-layer arrays; do not convert it to TMX/XML, an infinite map, base64 data, or compressed layer data.
5. Before packaging, run the template's verification script from PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   .\ModSDK\MapTemplates\verify-tiled-pack.ps1 -PackPath ".\path\to\your-mod"
   ```

If you also need Unity's packager and previews, complete [Install the authoring tools](installing-authoring-tools.md). Tiled itself can edit a stage without Unity running.

Export a finite orthogonal map as Tiled JSON. The experimental pipeline renders PNG-backed tile and image layers and constructs reviewed gameplay objects, including platforms, spawners, doors, vendors, registered pickups, pack-local `stage-item` key items, lights, moving platforms, navigation links, and interaction graphs. Exactly one `player-spawn` point defines the player start.

For a `stage-item` that should remain on a shelf or cabinet until collected, set `initiallyKinematic: true`. Its world pickup still works normally; items without this property retain dynamic physics.

The same `initiallyKinematic` property works on registered `pickup` points, such as a weapon displayed on a pedestal. A `proximity-light` can set `lightRotationZ` to preserve its source light shape's local rotation.

Tiled pixels are converted from a top-left, downward-positive coordinate system to Unity units using the stage definition's `pixelsPerUnit`.

Start with `ModSDK/MapTemplates/TiledStage`. It contains an editable map, a ready-to-copy stage definition, reusable `.tx` object templates, and a machine-readable summary of the supported gameplay objects.

Keep gameplay objects, decoration, platform art, repeated art, and backgrounds on their named layers. Select an object to inspect its template and supported per-instance Custom Properties.

Use `"extends": "core:stage/mod-template"` when the map should be stage-independent. This reserved base supplies only the runtime stage shell and shared object templates; it does not borrow layout, collision, actors, or scripted state from a playable Core location. Existing inherited ports can keep their current `core:stage/...` base while they migrate one object group at a time.

Object instances may use native Tiled `.tx` templates. Paths are resolved relative to the map or parent template, must remain inside the mod pack, and may override the template's fields and property array.

Spawner point names must match the corresponding `spawners[].id` values in the stage JSON exactly. Encounter configuration remains in the stage definition; Tiled owns positions and collision rectangles.

Tile layers use raw numeric arrays and embedded or external JSON/TSJ tilesets. PNG spritesheets, larger-than-grid tiles, margin/spacing, opacity, group offsets, and horizontal/vertical flips are supported. Tile objects with the `decoration` class render as scalable and rotatable visual props; their tileset's standard Tiled `objectalignment` value is honored, with an omitted or `unspecified` value using the orthogonal-map `bottomleft` default. `repeat: true` tiles a sprite across large rectangles. `tileMode` may be `continuous` or `adaptive`, with an `adaptiveModeThreshold` from 0 through 1. Exported legacy art can preserve four pixel-based `spriteBorder*` properties on its tileset so capped and sliced walls do not repeat the entire source image. Decorations may also set `sortingLayer` (`Sky`, `Background`, `Decoration`, or `Platform`), `sortingOrder` (-10000 through 10000), `opacity` (0 through 1), and an HTML-style `tintColor`. Object-layer opacity is multiplied by the decoration's own opacity. Point objects named `weapon-vendor` and `usable-vendor` instantiate shared vending-machine templates with the existing UI and catalogs. A `weapon-case` point creates a purchasable case using its `weapon` content-ID property and a `caseSize` from 1 through 3.

The `door` point class supports `standard`, `jacky`, and `roller` values in its `doorType` property. Give every door a unique object name. A `door-switch` point toggles the comma-separated door names in `targetDoors`. Standard and Jacky doors retain their Core behavior; roller doors retain their animation and use proximity activation unless linked to a switch.

The `note` class opens the existing reading HUD with authored text and font size. The `keypad` class accepts a numeric code and opens one or more named doors after successful entry. General interaction graphs provide additional conditions, actions, and cross-object links.

The `interaction` class supplies reusable logic for buttons, secrets, trigger zones, and shootable targets. The aliases `machine`, `logic-switch`, and `easter-egg-step` use the same validated graph. Set `trigger` to `use`, `touch`, or `shoot`; use objects are points while touch/shoot objects are rectangles. The starter kit includes preview-backed `.tx` templates for common machines, so they remain visible while editing in Tiled and become their proper runtime objects in game.

Interactions can require a wave range, living-enemy range, completed challenges, several activations, a registered inventory item, a minimum unspent money balance, or completion of other named interactions. Actions can delay, consume or grant items, add/remove money, heal the actor, apply knockback/ragdoll, control doors and lights, queue enemies, and activate other nodes. All content IDs and named links are checked while the pack loads, action-chain cycles are rejected, and an unavailable use interaction is checked before its price is charged.

`light-bulb` points can use the Core light presentation or paired pack-local `visualFile`/`activatedVisualFile` PNGs. Portable lights also accept initial/activated HTML colors, sprite PPU/pivot/sorting settings, and point-light inner radius, outer radius, and falloff. An interaction using `lightAction: activate` applies the activated sprite and color without first switching off an already-lit indicator.

`proximity-light` points are fully portable fixtures: a pack-local PNG and a 2D point or freeform light fade in while any actor is within `detectionRadius`, then fade out. Set `initiallyActive: false` for a fixture enabled later by a stage script's `set-object-active` action. `file`, `fadeSeconds`, `intensity`, `lightType`, `color`, `falloffIntensity`, `lightOffsetY`, `sortingLayer`, and `sortingOrder` define presentation. Point lights use `innerRadius` and `outerRadius`; freeform lights use `shapePath` (semicolon-separated `x,y` vertices in Unity units) and `shapeFalloffSize`.

`freeform-light` points create static 2D lighting without a Core prefab. Set `shapePath` to 3–64 semicolon-separated `x,y` vertices in Unity units, and `sortingLayers` to a comma-separated list of affected layers. `intensity`, `color`, `falloffIntensity`, `shapeFalloffSize`, and `initiallyActive` reproduce the authored light. Stage scripts can enable or disable a named light with `set-object-active`.

For a visible fixture, optional `file` supplies a pack-local PNG rendered at `pixelsPerUnit` on `sortingLayer`/`sortingOrder`. `lightOffsetY` and `lightRotationZ` place and orient the light relative to that sprite; this preserves FER's dormant laboratory panel light.

When a mod extends a Core stage and replaces one of its embedded lights, optional `suppressInheritedPath` names that original light's relative hierarchy path so it does not render a second time. This is only a suppression hint; the new light's geometry and appearance still come entirely from JSON.

A stage may define one `global-light` point with `intensity`, `color`, `falloffIntensity`, and affected `sortingLayers`. It replaces the inherited global light and becomes the target of the stage's global-light API and `set-global-light` stage-script actions.

`point-light` points create a standalone 2D cone light. Set its radii, inner/outer angles, rotation, color, intensity, falloff, affected sorting layers, and additive or alpha-blend overlap. Optional `pulseFrom`, `pulseTo`, and `pulseSeconds` reproduce a repeating two-phase alarm intensity cycle. `initiallyActive: false` and `suppressInheritedPath` support scripted replacement of dormant Core fixtures.

Interactions may additionally require a minimum/maximum number of living enemies or a comma-separated list of completed challenge content IDs. `visualArt` selects a published Core map-art ID so an interaction can appear as a machine instead of an invisible point. For fully portable stateful artwork, set both `visualFile` and `activatedVisualFile` to pack-local PNGs; `visualPixelsPerUnit`, `visualPivotX`, `visualPivotY`, `visualSortingLayer`, `visualSortingOrder`, and `visualScale` control how the two states render. The activated image replaces the normal image after a successful activation.

`ambient-audio` and `audio-source` points load bounded pack-local WAV/OGG files when the stage opens. Ambient audio is non-positional; positional audio uses configurable linear falloff. The optional `mixerGroup` property selects `Ambience` or `SFX` (their respective defaults). Native Tiled tileset animations are supported for painted tiles and tile-object decorations.

To replace inherited stage audio, add an optional `audio` object beside `layout` and `waves` in the stage definition. The `ambience`, `entryMusic`, `waveMusic`, and `waveComplete` fields each accept a pack-local WAV or OGG. Any omitted field continues using the inherited Core clip.

A `light-bulb` point clones a working Core fixture. `initiallyOn` controls its starting state and `flicker` accepts 0 through 1. Players can toggle it with Use or permanently break it by shooting it.

A `pickup` point instantiates a registered weapon, usable, or consumable from its full `item` content ID. `amount` may exceed one only for stackable items. A `moving-platform` rectangle travels by its `moveX`/`moveY` pixel offset and uses approved Core art. A `particle-emitter` point creates bounded looping particles without requiring a Unity prefab.

Named `nav-node` points supplement the automatically generated platform nodes. Place ground nodes on the top surface of their platform; the loader normalizes them to the Core walking-network height. Their comma-separated `links` are directed, `connectionType` is `move` or `climb`, and `fly: true` marks aerial routing. Set `bidirectional: true` to create the reverse edge automatically. For a ground `climb` link, upward traversal climbs while reverse/downward traversal walks off the ledge and falls. Missing and self-referencing links invalidate the map.

For multi-room maps, use the supplied `room.tx`, `room-entry.tx`, and `room-transition.tx` templates. Room rectangles control camera bounds. Transitions target named entries and may wait for active enemies to be cleared or become unavailable after one use. They do not save progression or replace the stage's normal player spawn.

An `altar` point clones the full Jungle altar sequence and rebinds it to the authored stage's wave and lighting systems.

Use a `core-art` rectangle to reuse a curated background or prop from the base game. Its `art` property selects a stable public ID listed in the starter kit's `reference/core-map-art.json`; the rectangle controls position and size. These visuals accept `Background`, `Decoration`, or `Platform` sorting and optional horizontal or vertical flips, but never create collision.

Tiled Image Layers support pack-local PNG files, visibility, opacity, offsets, nested groups, and horizontal or vertical repetition. They render on the background layer and are the preferred choice when the background should be visible in Tiled itself.

External JSON/TSJ tilesets are covered by `Docs/Modding/schemas/tiled-tileset.schema.json`. The validator checks their grid dimensions, relative PNG path, and bounded animation frames. A tileset may use `../` to reach another directory within its pack; the runtime resolves the final path and rejects it if it escapes the pack. Cross-field rules—such as whether the declared grid fits the image and whether animation tile IDs exist—are also enforced by the runtime loader.

XML TSX, compressed/base64 layers, diagonal transforms, and automatic tile-object collision remain unsupported.

Use `layout.hideInheritedVisuals: true` to replace the selected Core stage artwork. Collision remains explicit in the `Gameplay` object layer rather than being inferred from painted tiles.
