# Validation and error-code catalog

This searchable catalog is generated from literal validation calls in the runtime, editor tools, and repository validators. Use your browser search for an exact code shown by the Mods panel or authoring tool.

Regenerate it with `Tools/Documentation/Generate-ValidationCatalog.ps1`. Codes assembled dynamically at runtime may not appear here; the displayed message and source remain authoritative.

## Severity

- **Error:** the document, operation, or pack cannot proceed safely.
- **Warning:** content may load with a fallback or requires author attention.
- **Info:** state or platform information that does not itself invalidate content.
